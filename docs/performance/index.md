# Performance & Optimization

Optimize AI performance through quantization and efficient resource use.

## Overview

Balancing model accuracy, inference speed, and resource consumption requires understanding quantization techniques, latency requirements, and optimization strategies. For AI Agentic systems, additional considerations include token consumption, model routing, caching strategies, and comprehensive cost management.
