# Architecture & Frameworks

This section covers AI agent architectures, framework comparisons, and integration patterns for building agentic AI systems.

## Overview

Modern AI systems increasingly use agentic architectures where AI models act as autonomous agents that can reason, plan, use tools, and interact with external systems. Understanding these architectures and selecting the right frameworks is critical for successful implementation.

## Key Topics

### [Agentic Components Model](agentic-components-model.md)
Detailed breakdown of the 14 core components (C01-C14) in an agentic AI architecture:
- User interfaces and API gateways
- Identity and secrets management
- AI agent orchestration and LLM runtime
- Security controls and monitoring

### [Agent Frameworks Comparison](agent-frameworks-comparison.md)
Comprehensive comparison of popular frameworks:
- **LangGraph/LangChain**: Workflow-based agent orchestration
- **CrewAI**: Role-based multi-agent systems
- **Semantic Kernel**: Microsoft enterprise orchestration
- **AutoGen**: Experimental multi-agent frameworks

### [Integration Schemas](integration-schemas.md)
Visual schemas and patterns for integrating agentic AI into existing systems.

### [Agentic Use Case Schema](agentic-use-case-schema.md)
Specific architectural patterns for common agentic AI use cases.

### [Agentic Workflows](agentic-workflows.md)
How to integrate agentic AI workflows into enterprise environments, including Kubernetes deployments.
